            <p class="blue">Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension
                about what’s to come. If your susceptibility to anxiety is a high percentage, it means that you have
                been more anxious in this past month. This also means that you have had a combination of factors that
                have added to the anxiety in the last month, like work and school stress, a change in living
                arrangements, family and relationship problems, abuse or trauma, or loss of a loved one. Other factors
                such as your personality can affect your susceptibility to anxiety over a long period of time, like
                children who are perfectionists, easily flustered, timid, inhibited, lack self-esteem or want to control
                everything, sometimes develop anxiety during childhood, adolescence or as adults.

            <div class="oval"><p class="blue">Your Level of Stress</p></div>
            <p class="blue">Stress is defined as a state of mental or emotional strain caused by adverse circumstances.
                At one point or another, most people deal with feelings of stress. For example, if you're a teenage boy,
                and you're under heaps of stress, you may find that you have increased acne, according to Healthline.
                Another study looked at 2,699 children and found that exposure to stressful events was associated with
                an increased risk of constipation. What causes stress is very similar to anxiety, such as being under
                lots of pressure, facing big changes, not having much or any control over the outcome of a situation or
                times of uncertainty. Other factors like your perception of the situation, your emotional resilience to
                stressful situations, the amount of other pressures on you at the time and the amount of support you are
                receiving.

            <div class="oval"><p class="blue">How Burnt Out You Are</p></div>
            <p class="blue">People experiencing burnout often feel like they have nothing left to give and may dread
                getting out of bed each morning. They may even adopt a pessimistic outlook toward life and feel
                hopeless. Anyone who’s continually exposed to high levels of stress can experience burnout. Personality
                characteristics like needing to be in control, perfectionism, and being “Type A” can also increase your
                risk of burnout. If you've been feeling exhausted, isolated, may fantasize about running away or going
                on a solo-vacation, or may turn to drugs, alcohol, or food as a way to numb the emotional pain. Other
                symptoms like irritability or frequent illnesses are also a sign of burn out.
